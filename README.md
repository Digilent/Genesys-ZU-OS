# Genesys-ZU Petalinux Repository

This repository contains Vivado projects for all demos for the Genesys-ZU.

For more information about the Genesys-ZU, visit its [Resource Center](https://reference.digilentinc.com/programmable-logic/genesys-zu/start) on the Digilent Wiki.

## Repository Description

This repository contains the Petalinux projects for each of the demos requireing them provided for the Genesys-ZU. As each of these demos also requires a hardware design, and potentially software sources, this repository should not be used directly. The [Genesys-ZU](https://github.com/Digilent/Genesys-ZU) repository contains all sources for these demos across all tools, and pulls in all of this repository's sources by using it as a submodule.

For instructions on how to use this repository with git, and for additional documentation on the submodule and branch structures used, please visit [Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/documents/git) on the Digilent Wiki.
